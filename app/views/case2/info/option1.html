			<ul>
				<li>An oral tablet that works rapidly – as rapidly as a parenteral agent – to slow clot progression<sup>2,3</sup></li>
				<li>Single-drug approach (rivaroxaban or apixaban) allows early discharge from hospital – no overlap with a parenteral agent is needed. If LMWH has been administered initially, a switch to a single-drug NOAC (e.g. rivaroxaban) can follow at the same time 24 hours later (at hospital or home)<sup>4&ndash;7</sup></li>
				<li>Dabigatran and edoxaban require at least 5 days’ parenteral anticoagulation before switching<sup>8&ndash;11</sup></li>
				<li>3 months’ initial treatment then re-assess every 3 months<sup>1,12,13</sup></li>
				<li>Requirements: take tablet as directed at the same time(s) each day; review appointment with anticoagulation clinic/haematologist (at 21 days if using rivaroxaban to coincide with dose reduction from 15 mg bid to 20 mg od, or at 7 days if using apixaban to coincide with dose reduction from 10 mg bid to 5 mg bid); no known dietary restrictions or food interactions<sup>4&ndash;7</sup></li>
				<li>ESC guidelines recommend patients with a PESI score of 0 may be suitable for management at home. With an sPESI score of 1, inpatient monitoring should be considered<sup>1</sup></li>
