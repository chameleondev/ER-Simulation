		<p>Using three patient cases, this training simulation is designed for junior healthcare professionals in emergency care to support the prompt diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.</p>

		<!-- <p>This training programme has been designed for junior doctors working in an emergency room setting  to establish best-practice in the diagnosis and treatment of four virtual patient cases.</p> -->

		<p>Working through the patient simulations, guided by helpful hints, consultant advice and learning materials, will help you to apply scientific knowledge to clinical  practice. Decision points indicate the key stages of diagnosis and assessment and provide an opportunity to evaluate your level of understanding in each case.</p>
