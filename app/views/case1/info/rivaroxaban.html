		<li>An oral tablet that works rapidly – working as rapidly as a parenteral agent to slow clot progression – either rivaroxaban or apixaban </li>

		<li>Single-drug approach allows early discharge from hospital – no overlap with a parenteral agent is needed</li>

		<li>3 months’ treatment then re-assess</li>

		<li>Requirements: take tablet as directed at the same time(s) each day; review appointment with anticoagulation clinic/haematologist at 21 days (for rivaroxaban) or 7 days (for apixaban) to manage change in dose; no known dietary restrictions or food interactions</li>
